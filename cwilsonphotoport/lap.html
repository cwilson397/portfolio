                    Wow what a picture! I was lucky enough to be able to capture this image while on my recent trip to Alaska. When you get
                    the chance to see this, you have no time to mess with settings, in this instance, the whole situation, happened in less than 30 seconds.
                    No where near enough time to change settings and move you camera back up to take the picture. Which is the first think when it comes to 
                    animal photography, a landscape won't run away, so unless actively taking pictures of a landscape, have your camera ready for animals. I use a 
                    shutterspeed of at least 1000 which means a thousandth of a second. More often and in this picture, it was northwards of 2000. I also use an apperture of
                    10. As not only does appeture change light let in, it also changes whats in focus. The higher the number, the more thats in focus, basically f20 means, everone is important
                    f4.5 means only the subject is imporant. I use f-8 to f-10 because it is basically saying the subject is most important, but you know, lets get a little bit of the background as well. 
                    Then when using auto IsO you don't have to worry about it, If I remember the iso for this picture ended up being around 100, which is the lowest it will generally go, especially on older
                    cameras.

                    This picture is an amazing one. One of my favorite ever taken. If you saw the picture of jeeps on the <a class="inparagraph-link" href="gca.html">Getting Your Camera Off Auto</a>
                    page, this picture was also taken on that trip. Because this is a landscape picture, I can play with the settings more, higher apeture, it was around 22, and a shutter speed of around 400.
                    Now this is the part that people using their phones can also apply. When taking pictures with a reflection involved. I like to try and make the cost in the middle. I did the best I could for
                    this one, as these are absolutely massive mountains. But it is pretty close, and allows for a much more pleasing image to the mind. When taking landscape photos, if you have the ability to
                    try and use a tripod, and a remote shutter release. Also known as a camera remote, it allows for you to take the picture without touch the camera. Because when taking landscapes, you tend to have 
                    much lower shutter speeds, which can add blurryness, using a tripod removes the handholding aspect, and the whole remote, allows for the slight bump from the button to not affect your image. However
                    this was taken while handholding my camera, and still got this great picture, so it doesn't always affect the end result to not have that stuff.

                <p class="card-p-3">
                  First notice about this, it was taken in a wildlife park, behind a closed fence, and I was close to the bear which was behind a sturdy safe fence. Do not get this close to bears, or any animals in the wildlife
                  if you can help it, as they are wild animals, not pets, and will attack if threatened. I was only this close because this bear had been too socialized with humans, and knew that generally unless in specific situations
                  meant no harm, so that's why I could get that close. Now that the important stuff is out of the way, the fun stuff can begin. Almost all cameras have a burst, or continuous shooting mode. My phone can do that, just
                  by holding down on the button on the screen, and it takes until I release the button. My camera has a setting that allows for continuous shooting, and does the same thing. I have this, and continuous auto focus, which always
                  is refocusing the camera if anything changes, much better and faster than you can. I only get pictures like this one, because I hold the continuous shooting down. You end up with a lot more pictures, that admittely sucks. However,
                  like this sleeping bear, you are much more likely to get the one that you absolutely love. On my Alaska trip, I took over 4000 pictures, I kept only around 600. So the last bit of advice, you can try to edit the picture, I always do,
                  however you also have to relize that sometimes, you just have to throw away the picture because it didn't quite turn out right. But with practice more and more images are keepers.176943
