                    This image, is an example, of what many people are scared of when it comes to taking your camera off of auto, because I had my
                    settings wrong, I unfortantely was unable to get rid of a lot of the grain that showed up in this picture. I was eventually able to get 
                    a lot of that out, however it took some of the detail that comes along with it. I put this here, because while it can be scary to do that, without
                    taking that risk you won't necessarily be able to get those more impressive and wow worthy pictures. On this trip I was near Grand Teton National Park, and I had
                    many great pictures from this trip, but because I messed this one up, I thought it was the better example for this.

                    This image was taken on a jeep safari near Denali National Park, in Alaska, It is an example of what can go right when it comes 
                    to change from the A to the M or even the A on that dial on your camera. M meaning manual gives you full control over the settings 
                    of the camera, being able to set the apperture, the shutterspeed, and the iso sensitivity. Meaning how much light can get in, how fast the camera closes the shutter, stoping the light,
                    and how sensitive it is to that light. Where as with appeture priority mode, that A, it gives you the ability to say, alright I set the Iso, and the appeture, camera you set the shutter speed,
                    to get the best exposure possible. I stick with manual now adays, because there is a setting that you can set to have the iso automatically set, which gives the camera the ability to set isos, that
                    you can't get to. But because higher ISOS can cause grain to appear, you can set a higher limit to what the iso can go to, meaning the camera won't go any higher than that. These are all great things to 
                    do, there are many tutorials online that can lead to better knowledge of your camera. I personally recommend the philosophy of Chris Balmer, who owns perfect light camera store, and teaches classes about
                    this. However as his stuff costs money, I would first start with some of the online stuff for free, on youtube to see if you are really into this.
