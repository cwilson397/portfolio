                    This image was taken near a small town in Eastern Idaho, known as Hamer Idaho. It is a small blink and you miss it town, but it does happen to have nearby,
                    a wildlife refuge. A lot of eagles, actually happen to live around there, some wintering there, others year round. It is a really great place to go,
                    to experience the majesty that is this nation's national bird. In order to learn more about how I got this image, check out the page titled <a class="inparagraph-link" href="lap.html">Landscape and Animal Photography</a>
                    where I will have gone more in depth about settings for taking pictures like this one and others.

                    This image was taken from a cruise ship, while traveling through the inner passage of Alaska, and down through Canada towards vancouver. This img, in the way it came out would not be possible
                    were I still using my camera on its Auto setting. As that automatically changes the settings to try and get the best exposure for your picture possible. Which, admittely is pretty useful, it can prevent
                    you from taking your photography to the next level and allowing you to get more amazing shots, next time you take your camera out. To learn my methodology and how I did it, check out <a class="inparagraph-link" href="gca.html">

                    This final image was also taken locally, in the National Elk Refuge located in Jackson Wyoming. This place is a favorite of mine to go shooting,
                    around the end of the year, as that is when the Big Horn sheep will be right next to the road, allowing you to get amazing shots, without the expensive equipment.
                    You will however need to be careful, as because of the road salt, which can be dangerous to the animals, they will start to lick your car. I had an encounter with a 
                    Bull Moose, Licking the outside of my car, until it finally decided to leave, so keep that in mind with winter photography, and photography in general, it is important
                    to pay attention to the rules and regulations, of the area you plan to go shooting in, so that you are protecting yourself, the environment, and the animals. To presever this 
                    natural beauty for future generations. Which is what I believe is the main purpose of photography, to show people, what an area looks like, so they can experience it
                    through your eyes. As a photographer, you have a special power, that has never before existed in the world. You have the ability to freeze time, to capture a moment in history
                    exactly as it happened. So when following my advice, remember, the most important is this, if you can't get the shot you want, just put the camera down. It's more important to experience,
                    the world, rather than capture it.
