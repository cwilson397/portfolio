Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

This semester, when creating my fortipass program, I realized that through splitting up functions, it allowed me to actually write less code, where as before I wouldve ended up making this a very long program, it ended up being really short because of the reusability of the code.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

It allows you to find errors easily, and figure out exactly where a failure is occuring if enough are written. I actually found one in my program this past week. 

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
Honestly my process is finding the line where it says the error is and trying to figure out the error code, I could maybe use tools to find the errors faster, but I honestly don't know if I have a speciifc process. I need to create one.
